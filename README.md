# Newsletter-Manager
A web based newsletter manager

This is a simple web based newsletter manager. I created it for a customer and I chose to publish it.
I have a lot of features to implement and a lot of issues to resolve and I would be happy if someone will help to improve this
application.

With this application you can add new users with name, email, date of birth and a category so that you can filter the newsletter
for age or category or something else.
You can create different models so that you can resend the same email more times.
You can set a maximum number of emails to send every day every day so, if you have a limit smtp server, you can create a queue
emails that will be send automatically each day.

LANGUAGES:
html (of course), php, javascript (jQuery), css.
I'm using Bootstrap for the graphic implementation. I'm not using a mvc architecture (if anyone want to suggest a new
structure, he is welcome).

I'm using tinymce for the editor and fileman to upload images.
